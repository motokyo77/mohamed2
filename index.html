        handful of Chinese display manufacturers are reportedly teaming up and

        earlier efforts to stop imports of third-party displays that may be
        infringing on its technologies.

        but the fact is there are no other Windows laptops that integrate
        Android devices quite like the Galaxy Book 3 does.
